Bullshit SOAP
=============
*my own shitty and aggressively written manual SOAP Library*

Used as an SOAP Parser for android apps, because android has no SOAP parser included.

>**Warning:**
>This is not a complete SOAP Library - the basic features are there, and everything I needed.
>But I did not strive for completeness. Adding missing stuff will be your job (But I'm always happy about pull requests :D)
